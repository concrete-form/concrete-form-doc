## About

`React Hook Form` is an awesome performance-centric library. `React Hook Form` prefers uncontrolled fields in order to optimize performance. This library exposes a series of custom hooks developed on a subscription based system in order to limit the renders as much as possible.

If you're still wondering which Form library to use on your project, we recommend `React Hook Form`.

## Install

yarn add @concrete-form/react-hook-form
