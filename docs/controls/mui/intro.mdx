## Dependencies

**Material-UI**

This library is an implementation of Material-UI. You still need MUI and it's dependencies on your project. [Visit this page for more info](/docs/getting-started/install).

**@mui/x-date-pickers**

If you want to use `<DateTime />` control, don't forget to install `@mui/x-date-pickers`. You also need to provide a date library to MUI, [please check their doc about Pickers](https://mui.com/components/pickers/#setup).
