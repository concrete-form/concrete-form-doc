# Introduction

## Forms and React
- There are already good form libraries for React. ([`React Hook Form`](https://react-hook-form.com/), [`Formik`](https://formik.org/), ...)
- There are already good UI kits for React ([`Material-UI`](https://mui.com/), [`Semantic UI`](https://semantic-ui.com/), ...)

**Using them together always mean a lot of boiler plate before you're ready to start coding your forms.**
## Here comes Concrete Form

**Concrete-Form** render the most common form controls that you need no matter what **UI kit** you are using, registers them automatically on the **form library of your choice**. 

- We **render** the controls
- We **register** the controls on the form library
- We **display the errors**
- We help you to **translate** the validation errors
- We help you with **unit tests**

### Example
> **`React Hook Form`** with **`Material-UI`**

<BasicDemo dense />

#### `<Form>`
- Render an HTML `<form>` element
- Can accept an existing form created with [`useForm()`](https://react-hook-form.com/api/useform) or we'll create it for you

#### `<Input>` + `<SubmitButton>`
- Render a `MUI TextField` and a `MUI Button`
- Since it's inside `<Form>`, "**name**" input is registered automatically on `React Hook Form`.
- Errors are displayed automatically

- You can instanciate the form yourself and use any settings that you want
- You can provide parameters when registering the field on the form
- We make no design decision and you can customize 100% of the UI
